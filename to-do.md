-remove coffee mug
-i was this to be web and ios compatible, so whole desk visible on web and zoomed in on mobile, user can pan left and right and zoom out to see full desk
-should be able to move the yellow notepad just like the other elements. And let user "tear" off page, and move that page around too.
-make sure you can move file tray.
-Remove the drawers component, users can just use manilla envelopes and the file cabiner
-the file cabinet should, when opened, have sections, and the drawer open ui should pull out each section with tab names visible like a real one POC
